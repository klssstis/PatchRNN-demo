PatchRNN is a deep learning based model to identify security patches in software using recurrent neural networks. 
Due to the different structures of patch components, PatchRNN tends to process the commit message and the code revision individually hence conducting a more comprehensive analysis.
The code revision in patches is processed using a twin RNN model with a static analytic tool, while the commit message is processed with a TextRNN model with NLP techniques. 
Afterward, the information from the commit message and the code revision is fused to get the final prediction using a multi-layer perceptron.

More details about the PatchRNN can be found in the paper "[PatchRNN: A Deep Learning-Based System for Security Patch Identification](https://shuwang127.github.io/papers/milcom21_PatchRNN.pdf)", to appear in the IEEE/AFCEA MILCOM 2021, San Diego, USA, November 29â€“December 2, 2021.

## PatchRNN design

### 1. Overview

Figure 1 presents the architecture of our PatchRNN toolkit.
Since a commit (i.e., a patch file) is composed of code revision and commit message, we utilize both parts to capture more comprehensive features. 
For code revision, we reconstruct the unpatched code and patched code and process them separately with the same tokenization and abstraction strategies.
Then a twin RNN model is adopted to generate the code vector representation. 
For the commit message, we utilize the NLP toolkit to process the text sequences and employ a TextRNN model to obtain vector representation for commit message.
The final results are derived from the feature vectors of both parts. 
We use a large-scale patch dataset [PatchDB](https://sunlab-gmu.github.io/PatchDB/) to train the model. The size of the dataset is 38K.

From the perspective of process flow, our system can be divided into 4 phases: text processing, featurization, RNN-based feature vector extraction, and finial identification. From the perspective of process objects, our system can be divided into 3 modules: code revision processing, commit message processing, and fused predictive modeling.

### 2. Code revision processing

- code revision extraction: `ReadDiffLines(filename)` in `ReadData()`
- tokenization: `GetDiffProps(data)`
  - code tokenization: `tk`
  - token type recognition: `tkT`
  - diff type recognition: `dfT`
- token preprocessing: `ProcessTokens(props, dType=1, cType=1)`
  - maintain context? `dType`
  - maintain comments? `cType`
- token abstraction: `AbstractTokens(props, iType=1, lType=1)`
  - how to abstract identifiers? `iType`
  - how to abstract literals? `lType`
- token embedding generation: `GetDiffEmbed(tokenDict, embedSize)`
- unpatched and patched code division: `DivideBeforeAfter(diffProps)`
- unpatched and patched code preprocessing
  - indexed data convertion: `GetTwinMapping(props, maxLen, tokenDict)`
  - one-hot data convertion: `UpdateTwinTokenTypes(data)`
- twin RNN model
``` python
# twin 1.
  xTwin = x[:, :_TwinMaxLen_, :6]
  embedsTwin = self.embedTwin(xTwin[:, :, 0])
  features = xTwin[:, :, 1:]
  inputsTwin = torch.cat((embedsTwin.float(), features.float()), 2)
  inputsTwin = inputsTwin.permute(1, 0, 2)
  lstm_out, (h_n, c_n) = self.lstmTwin(inputsTwin)
  featMapTwin1 = torch.cat([h_n[i, :, :] for i in range(h_n.shape[0])], dim=1)
# twin 2.
  xTwin = x[:, :_TwinMaxLen_, 6:-1]
  embedsTwin = self.embedTwin(xTwin[:, :, 0])
  features = xTwin[:, :, 1:]
  inputsTwin = torch.cat((embedsTwin.float(), features.float()), 2)
  inputsTwin = inputsTwin.permute(1, 0, 2)
  lstm_out, (h_n, c_n) = self.lstmTwin(inputsTwin)
  featMapTwin2 = torch.cat([h_n[i, :, :] for i in range(h_n.shape[0])], dim=1)
# combine twins.
  featMap = torch.cat((featMapTwin1, featMapTwin2), dim=1)
```

### 3. Commit message processing

- commit message extraction: `ReadCommitMsg(filename)` in `ReadData()`
- commit message preprocessing: `GetCommitMsgs(data)`
  - URL removel
  - independent number removel
  - lower case convertion
  - footnote removel
  - word tokenization
  - non-english letter verification
  - stopword clearance
  - word stemming
- word embedding generation: `GetMsgEmbed(tokenDict, embedSize)`
- embedding mapping: `GetMsgMapping(msgs, maxLen, tokenDict)`
- TextRNN model
``` python
# msg.
  xMsg = x[:, :_MsgMaxLen_, -1]
  embedsMsg = self.embedMsg(xMsg)
  inputsMsg = embedsMsg.permute(1, 0, 2)
  lstm_out, (h_n, c_n) = self.lstmMsg(inputsMsg)
  featMapMsg = torch.cat([h_n[i, :, :] for i in range(h_n.shape[0])], dim=1)
```

### 4. Fused predictive modeling

- fully-connected network
``` python
# fc layers.
  featMap = self.fc1(featMap)
  if (0 == _TWIN_): # (only twins).
    final_out = self.fc2(featMap)
  elif (1 == _TWIN_): # (twins + msg).
    featMap = torch.cat((featMap, featMapMsg), dim=1)
    featMap = self.fc3(featMap)
    final_out = self.fc4(featMap)
  return self.softmax(final_out)     
```
