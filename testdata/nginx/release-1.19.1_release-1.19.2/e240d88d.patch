Subject: [PATCH] Core: added a warning about reusing connections.

Previously, reusing connections happened silently and was only
visible in monitoring systems.  This was shown to be not very user-friendly,
and administrators often didn't realize there were too few connections
available to withstand the load, and configured timeouts (keepalive_timeout
and http2_idle_timeout) were effectively reduced to keep things running.

To provide at least some information about this, a warning is now logged
(at most once per second, to avoid flooding the logs).
