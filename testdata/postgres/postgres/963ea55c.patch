Subject: [PATCH] Doc: correct thinko in pg_buffercache documentation.

Access to this module is granted to the pg_monitor role, not
pg_read_all_stats.  (Given the view's performance impact,
it seems wise to be restrictive, so I think this was the
correct decision --- and anyway it was clearly intentional.)

Per bug #16279 from Philip Semanchuk.
