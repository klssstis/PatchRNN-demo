Subject: [PATCH] Add comment to explain an unused function parameter

Removing the unused 'miinfo' parameter has been raised a couple of times
now.  It was decided in the 2nd discussion below that we're going to leave
it alone.  It seems like it might be useful to add a comment to mention
this fact so that nobody wastes any time in the future proposing its
removal again.
