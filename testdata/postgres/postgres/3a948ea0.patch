Subject: [PATCH] pg_hba.conf.sample: Reword connection type section

Improve the wording in the connection type section of
pg_hba.conf.sample a bit.  After the hostgssenc part was added on, the
whole thing became a bit wordy, and it's also a bit inaccurate for
example in that the current wording for "host" appears to say that it
does not apply to GSS-encrypted connections.
