Subject: [PATCH] Remove some useless logs from the TAP tests of pgbench
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

002_pgbench_no_server was printing some array pointers instead of the
actual contents of those arrays for the expected outputs of stdout and
stderr for a tested command.  This does not add any new information that
can help with debugging as the test names allow to track failure
locations, if any.

This commit simply removes those logs as the rest of the printed
information is redundant with command_checks_all().

Per discussion with Andrew Dunstan and √Ålvaro Herrera.
