Subject: [PATCH] docs: use consistent markup for PostgreSQL

"PostgreSQL" should use <productname> markup consistenktly, so that
if we do apply styling on it it will be consistently applied.  Fix
by renaming the one exception to the rule.

      To complicate matters, some jurisdictions have used the same timezone
      abbreviation to mean different UTC offsets at different times; for
      example, in Moscow <literal>MSK</literal> has meant UTC+3 in some years and
-     UTC+4 in others.  <application>PostgreSQL</application> interprets such
+     UTC+4 in others.  <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> interprets such
      abbreviations according to whatever they meant (or had most recently
      meant) on the specified date; but, as with the <literal>EST</literal> example
      above, this is not necessarily the same as local civil time on that date.
